"UD_points.m" and "CUD_points.m" are two matlab functions that generate sample points of uncorrelated dimension (UD) quadrature
and  compound uncorrelated dimension (CUD) quadrature respectively. They need the subroutine "UCC_2D_function_v3.m". 

For the simple usage see the  explanations in the commend of the code. 

Unfortunately currently only sample points of a list of choosed dimension number and "K" number are available. This list would
be enlonged soon.
